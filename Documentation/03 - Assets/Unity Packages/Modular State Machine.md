## 📝 How to use
### Controller component.
- Select the GameObject you want to add the state machine to, click 'Add Component' and search for 'State Machine Controller'.
- Drag and drop your state machine (State Machine data SO) to the 'Root Machine'

### How to create the state machine.
- In Unity's project window, right-click in the folder where you want the state machine created. In the right-click menu go to **Create > Modular State Machine > State Machine**.
- Now you have a State Machine asset where you have a 'Initial State' field to drop a 'state (StateComposite)' to.
